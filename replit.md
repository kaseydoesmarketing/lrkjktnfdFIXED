# TitleTesterPro - YouTube A/B Testing Platform

## Overview

TitleTesterPro is a full-stack web application designed to help YouTubers optimize their video titles through automated A/B testing. The platform allows users to test multiple title variants, automatically rotate titles based on configurable intervals, and analyze performance metrics to determine the best-performing titles.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18+ with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with Shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Data Visualization**: Recharts for charts and analytics
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Custom session-based auth with Google OAuth integration
- **Scheduler**: Node.js cron jobs for automated title rotation and data polling
- **API Integration**: YouTube Data API v3 for video analytics

### Database Design
- **Users**: Store user profiles and OAuth tokens (encrypted)
- **Tests**: Track A/B test configurations and status
- **Titles**: Store title variants for each test
- **Analytics**: Historical performance data for each title
- **Sessions**: User session management

## Key Components

### Authentication System
- Google OAuth 2.0 integration for YouTube API access
- Session-based authentication with encrypted token storage
- Automatic token refresh handling
- Protected routes requiring authentication

### Test Management
- Create A/B tests with multiple title variants
- Configure rotation intervals (minutes between title changes)
- Choose success metrics (CTR or Average View Duration)
- Pause, resume, and complete tests

### Automated Scheduler
- Background job system using Node.js cron
- Automatic title rotation based on configured intervals
- Periodic analytics polling from YouTube API
- Data aggregation and summary generation

### Analytics Dashboard
- Real-time performance metrics visualization
- Comparative analysis between title variants

## Data Flow

1. **User Authentication**: Users authenticate via Google OAuth to access YouTube API
2. **Test Creation**: Users create A/B tests by providing video URL and title variants
3. **Title Rotation**: Scheduler automatically rotates video titles at configured intervals
4. **Data Collection**: System polls YouTube API for performance metrics (views, impressions, CTR, AVD)
5. **Analysis**: Analytics engine processes data to identify winning titles
6. **Reporting**: Users view results through interactive dashboards and export data
