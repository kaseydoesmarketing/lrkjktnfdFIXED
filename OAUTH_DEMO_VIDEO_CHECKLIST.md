# OAuth Demo Video Recording Checklist

## Google's Specific Requirements
Google rejected your app because "Your demo video does not show the OAuth consent flow." This checklist ensures you capture exactly what they need to see.

## Pre-Recording Setup
- [ ] Use kaseydoesmarketing@gmail.com (your approved test account)
- [ ] Clear browser cache and cookies
- [ ] Close all other tabs to avoid distractions
- [ ] Test your screen recording software
- [ ] Have 2-3 test videos ready on your YouTube channel

## Critical Recording Points

### 1. Show Full OAuth Consent Screen (MANDATORY)
Google's verification team must see:
- [ ] The full Google consent screen with all requested scopes visible
- [ ] Each permission listed clearly on screen
- [ ] Your voice explaining why each permission is needed
- [ ] The moment you click "Allow" to grant permissions

### 2. Narration Script for Consent Screen
**Say this exactly when the consent screen appears:**

*"Here's Google's consent screen showing the permissions TitleTesterPro needs. The app is requesting:*
- *View my YouTube account - to display my channel information*  
- *Manage my YouTube videos - to update video titles during A/B tests*
- *View YouTube Analytics - to measure which titles perform better*
- *Access my email - for account authentication*

*These permissions are essential for automated title testing. I'll click Allow to grant these permissions."*
