**Script to Follow:**

```
"Hi, I'm [Your Name], and this is TitleTesterPro - a YouTube title optimization platform.

Let me show you how it works with our demo mode while we complete Google's verification process.

[Click Enter Demo Mode]

Here's our dashboard showing sample YouTube channel data. Content creators can see their recent videos and performance metrics.

[Show dashboard with stats cards]

Let me create a new A/B test. I'll select this sample video about CSS tutorials.

[Navigate to create test, select video]

Now I'll add multiple title variants to test which performs better:
- 'CSS Grid vs Flexbox: Complete Guide'  
- 'Master CSS Layouts: Grid vs Flexbox'
- 'CSS Grid vs Flexbox: Which Should You Use?'

[Add titles, set rotation interval]

The app will automatically rotate between these titles every few hours and collect performance data.

[Show analytics dashboard]

Here's how results look - we can see click-through rates, view duration, and determine the winning title based on real YouTube analytics.

[Explain data usage]

For privacy, we only access video titles and basic analytics. No personal content is stored, and users maintain full control over their data.

This demonstrates why we need YouTube API access - to read analytics data and update video titles for legitimate A/B testing purposes.

Thank you for reviewing TitleTesterPro."
