TitleTesterPro is a YouTube title optimization platform that helps content creators increase video performance through automated A/B testing. Our platform provides data-driven insights to help creators optimize their video titles and increase click-through rates by 15-30%.

DETAILED SCOPE JUSTIFICATIONS:

YOUTUBE.READONLY SCOPE - CRITICAL FOR CORE FUNCTIONALITY:
- VIDEO SELECTION: Users must select from their existing videos to create A/B tests. We retrieve the user's video list (videos.list) to populate the test creation interface with their content.
- BASELINE METRICS: We access current video metadata including titles, descriptions, view counts, and publication dates to establish baseline performance before testing begins.
- CHANNEL INFORMATION: We display user's channel name, subscriber count, and basic channel information in the dashboard for personalized experience.
- TEST VALIDATION: We verify video ownership and access permissions before allowing users to create tests on their content.
- HISTORICAL DATA: We retrieve video statistics to show users their content performance trends and help them make informed testing decisions.

YOUTUBE SCOPE - ESSENTIAL FOR AUTOMATED TESTING:
- TITLE ROTATION: Our core feature automatically updates video titles during A/B tests. We use videos.update to change titles between variants according to user-defined rotation schedules (e.g., every 2 hours, daily).
- AUTOMATED TESTING: Users set up tests with multiple title variants, and our system automatically rotates between them without manual intervention. This requires write access to modify video metadata.
- WINNER IMPLEMENTATION: When tests conclude, users can permanently apply the winning title variant to their video. This requires updating the video title with the optimal variant.
- ROLLBACK CAPABILITY: If users want to revert to original titles, we update the video metadata back to the original state.
- BATCH OPERATIONS: For users running multiple tests, we efficiently update multiple video titles in sequence.

YOUTUBE.FORCE-SSL SCOPE - SECURITY REQUIREMENT:
- SECURE OPERATIONS: All API calls for updating video titles and accessing sensitive analytics data are performed over HTTPS to ensure data integrity and prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.
- COMPLIANCE: YouTube requires HTTPS for all operations involving content modification to maintain platform security standards.
- DATA PROTECTION: Encrypts all communications between our platform and YouTube's API to protect user's content and analytics data.

YT-ANALYTICS.READONLY SCOPE - PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT:
- A/B TEST EFFECTIVENESS: We track key performance indicators (impressions, clicks, click-through rates, average view duration) for each title variant to determine statistical significance.
- PERFORMANCE COMPARISON: We compare metrics between different title variants to identify which titles drive more engagement and views.
- TREND ANALYSIS: We analyze performance data over time to show users how their title changes impact video performance.
- OPTIMIZATION INSIGHTS: We provide detailed analytics showing which title elements (keywords, length, emotional triggers) perform best for their content.
- STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE: We calculate confidence intervals and p-values to ensure test results are statistically meaningful before recommending title changes.

USERINFO.EMAIL & USERINFO.PROFILE SCOPES - USER AUTHENTICATION:
- SECURE LOGIN: We use Google OAuth for secure user authentication without storing passwords.
- PERSONALIZED DASHBOARD: We display user's name and profile information for personalized dashboard experience.
- ACCOUNT MANAGEMENT: We link user's Google account to their TitleTesterPro account for seamless access to their test history and results.
- COMMUNICATION: We use email for sending test completion notifications and important account updates (with user consent).

DATA USAGE:
- Only accesses authenticated user's own YouTube data
- Stores minimal test configurations and aggregated performance metrics
- No cross-user data access or third-party sharing
- Users can delete their data anytime
