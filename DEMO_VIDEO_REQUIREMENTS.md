"Hi, I'm demonstrating TitleTesterPro, a YouTube title optimization platform.

[Show homepage] Here's our homepage with clear privacy policy access.

[Click Start Testing] Let me sign in with Google to connect my YouTube account.

[OAuth flow] The app requests specific permissions - to read my video list, update titles during tests, and access analytics to measure performance. This is exactly what's needed for automated A/B testing. I'll click Allow.

[Dashboard] Now I'm connected and can see my YouTube channel data securely displayed.

[Create test] I can select any of my videos and create title variants to test automatically. The app will rotate titles and measure which performs better.

[Privacy emphasis] Throughout this process, my data stays private and secure. TitleTesterPro only accesses what I've authorized and never shares data with third parties."
