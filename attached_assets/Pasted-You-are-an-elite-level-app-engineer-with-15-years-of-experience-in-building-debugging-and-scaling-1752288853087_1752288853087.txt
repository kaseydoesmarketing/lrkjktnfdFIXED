You are an elite-level app engineer with 15+ years of experience in building, debugging, and scaling web apps.
This project is a web application that allows users to authenticate via Google OAuth (for YouTube), access their dashboard, and select/upload their YouTube videos for A/B testing.
The stack involves:
✅ Frontend: [Insert stack here, e.g., React/Vue/etc.]
✅ Backend: [Node/Express/Django/etc.]
✅ Database: [PostgreSQL via Supabase/Neon/etc.]
✅ Auth: Google OAuth 2.0 + refresh token flow
✅ Hosting: [Insert if known, e.g., Vercel/Heroku]

🛠 Mission:
Conduct a deep, top-to-bottom debug and audit of the entire system, covering:

User login / authentication

Dashboard data fetching & rendering

YouTube API integration & video selection

Database integrity & token storage

Frontend → backend → third-party flow

Error handling, edge cases, logs

You must:

Identify all misconfigurations, broken flows, and missing dependencies.

Suggest and/or implement fixes with explanation.

Document what went wrong, why it happens, and what needs to change.

Optimize where possible (e.g., improve refresh logic, loading states, etc.)

Include any security or UX concerns.

🔎 Steps To Execute:
1️⃣ OAuth & Login Flow
✅ Verify Google Developer Console setup:

Correct client_id and client_secret

Proper redirect URIs

Required scopes (e.g., https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly)
✅ Check if your frontend properly initiates OAuth (correct URL, no typo).
✅ Ensure backend correctly exchanges code for tokens.
✅ Confirm refresh token flow is implemented and tested.
✅ Look for token storage vulnerabilities or race conditions.
✅ Test logout flow too — clean session and revoke tokens if necessary.
✅ Test what happens if token expires mid-session — does it silently refresh?

2️⃣ Database
✅ Audit user/account table:

Does it store Google/YT user id uniquely?

Are access & refresh tokens stored and encrypted properly?
✅ Check DB migrations: are columns up-to-date for new OAuth fields?
✅ Validate relationships — e.g., user ↔ test ↔ video ↔ stats.

3️⃣ Dashboard
✅ Confirm that after login:

User is redirected to the correct dashboard page.

API calls use valid tokens & user IDs.
✅ Check that dashboard pulls the right data for the logged-in account (not stale data, not another user’s data).
✅ Verify all displayed metrics (CTR, views, tests) are correct.
✅ Ensure proper loading states & error messages when API fails.

4️⃣ Video Selection & YouTube API
✅ Test /api/videos/channel endpoint:

Confirm it uses a valid, fresh token.

Catch & log 401, 403, quota errors.
✅ Make sure YouTube API calls respect quota limits.
✅ Validate pagination & retrieval of all videos, not just first page.
✅ Test UI video selection — are selected videos properly recorded in the DB?
✅ Edge cases:

Empty channel (no videos)

Channel with thousands of videos

Private & unlisted videos — how are they handled?

5️⃣ Frontend
✅ Check login & dashboard pages render properly across browsers & devices.
✅ Validate frontend state management for auth/session.
✅ Inspect console & network logs for silent errors.
✅ Audit for memory leaks, long-running requests, poor loading UX.

6️⃣ Error Handling & Logs
✅ Review all server logs for errors, stack traces.
✅ Check if errors are being swallowed silently.
✅ Validate graceful fallback UX for all API failures.
✅ Confirm that unexpected states (e.g., revoked token) are handled and surfaced clearly.

7️⃣ Security
✅ Ensure no secrets are hardcoded in the frontend.
✅ Verify HTTPS is enforced everywhere.
✅ Sanitize all user input to prevent XSS/SQLi.
✅ Test session fixation & CSRF.

📄 Deliverables:
When done, output the following:

✅ A documented list of all issues found, prioritized (Critical → Minor).

✅ Explanation of root cause for each.

✅ Suggested fixes or code snippets for each.

✅ Any recommended improvements (scaling, UX, security, performance).

✅ Confirmation checklist: ✅ Login tested, ✅ Dashboard tested, ✅ Video selection tested, ✅ DB integrity, ✅ API quotas respected.

🔗 Notes:
If you encounter a blocker or an external dependency you can’t resolve (e.g., Google quota exhausted, missing API key), document it explicitly with steps needed to fix.

Assume you are allowed to make schema changes and modify both backend & frontend.

Be absolutely thorough. Assume nothing is correct until verified.
