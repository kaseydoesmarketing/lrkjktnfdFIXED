CRITICAL DASHBOARD DEBUG MISSION
PROBLEM SUMMARY
The dashboard was working perfectly before a recent revamp. Now it briefly appears then disappears into a white background. OAuth and video data pulling are affected. This needs a COMPLETE solution NOW.

YOUR SYSTEMATIC DEBUG PROTOCOL
PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSTIC
Browser Console Analysis
Check for JavaScript errors, warnings, and failed network requests
Look for React/framework-specific errors
Document any 401/403 OAuth-related errors
Screenshot all console output
Network Tab Investigation
Identify failed API calls, especially OAuth and video data endpoints
Check response codes and response bodies
Look for CORS issues or authentication failures
Document timing of successful vs failed requests
PHASE 2: CODE COMPARISON ANALYSIS
Git Diff Deep Dive
Compare the working pre-revamp commit with current broken state
Focus on: authentication logic, API calls, component lifecycle, routing
Identify ALL changes to OAuth flow, video data fetching, and dashboard rendering
Dependency Changes
Check package.json changes between working and broken versions
Look for version conflicts, especially auth libraries, UI frameworks
Verify all dependencies are properly installed and compatible
PHASE 3: AUTHENTICATION FLOW AUDIT
OAuth Implementation Review
Trace the complete OAuth flow from login to token refresh
Check token storage (localStorage, cookies, memory)
Verify token expiration handling and refresh logic
Test OAuth flow isolation in a minimal environment
API Authorization Testing
Test each video data API endpoint independently
Verify headers, tokens, and authentication are properly attached
Check for changed API endpoints or authentication requirements
PHASE 4: RENDERING PIPELINE INVESTIGATION
Component Lifecycle Analysis
Add detailed logging to dashboard component mount/unmount cycles
Check for premature component destruction
Identify what triggers the white background state
Look for conditional rendering logic that might be failing
State Management Audit
Review global state, Redux/Context changes
Check for state clearing or reset that causes re-renders
Verify data persistence between component re-renders
PHASE 5: SYSTEMATIC TESTING
Isolation Testing
Create minimal dashboard component without revamp changes
Gradually add revamp features until the issue reproduces
Test in different browsers and clear cache/cookies
Performance Monitoring
Check for memory leaks or performance issues causing crashes
Monitor component render times and API response times
Look for infinite loops or excessive re-rendering
PHASE 6: DEFINITIVE SOLUTION
Root Cause Documentation
Document the exact cause with code snippets
Explain the sequence of events leading to the white background
Provide before/after code comparison
Implementation & Verification
Implement the fix with detailed comments
Test thoroughly across all scenarios (fresh login, token refresh, etc.)
Verify OAuth and video data functionality is restored
Confirm the dashboard remains stable under various conditions
DELIVERABLES REQUIRED
Complete diagnostic report with screenshots
Exact root cause explanation
Working code fix with explanations
Testing verification results
Prevention measures for future revamps
SUCCESS CRITERIA
✅ Dashboard loads and remains stable ✅ OAuth flow works flawlessly
✅ Video data pulls correctly ✅ No white background disappearing ✅ Solution tested across browsers ✅ Code is production-ready

PRIORITY: CRITICAL - Solve this completely and permanently. No partial fixes.
