🔎 WHAT YOU MISSED & MUST COMPLETE
🔷 1. ✅ RUNTIME TOKEN VALIDATION
You failed to confirm the runtime OAuth token includes the correct scopes and is tied to the correct channel.
You MUST:

Run:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <ACCESS_TOKEN>" https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/tokeninfo
✅ Verify it contains BOTH:

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly

https://www.googleapis.com/auth/yt-analytics.readonly
✅ Confirm the token is issued for the Google account that actually owns the videoId you are querying.

🚨 If the account uses a Brand Account, ensure the user selected the correct Brand during OAuth and that channel==MINE resolves to the correct channelId.

🔷 2. ✅ FRONTEND & DASHBOARD VERIFICATION
You ignored the frontend/dashboard entirely.
You MUST:

Open the dashboard.

Confirm the following appear visibly:
✅ Active title
✅ Timestamp when current title started
✅ Interval duration
✅ Full history of rotated titles (with timestamps & intervals).

If the frontend does NOT display these, trace:

If the backend endpoint (/api/title-rotations or equivalent) returns correct data.

If the frontend component is actually calling this endpoint and rendering the state properly.

If the React/Vue state is updating correctly.

🚨 If not, fix both backend response & frontend logic.

🔷 3. ✅ DATABASE INTEGRITY
You partially fixed token storage but ignored database integrity, schema, and RLS.
You MUST:

Run:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;

SELECT 'tests' AS table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM tests
UNION ALL
SELECT 'videos', COUNT(*) FROM videos
UNION ALL
SELECT 'titles', COUNT(*) FROM titles
UNION ALL
SELECT 'analytics_polls', COUNT(*) FROM analytics_polls
UNION ALL
SELECT 'test_rotation_logs', COUNT(*) FROM test_rotation_logs;
✅ Verify:

All expected tables exist and have correct schema.

Foreign key relationships are intact.

Tables contain relevant rows.

Data types match expected API data.

🚨 Check if Row-Level Security (RLS) is enabled on any tables. If yes, temporarily disable it to test if it’s blocking writes/reads.

🚨 Validate that both Supabase & Neon are NOT being used simultaneously. Confirm which DB is active.

🔷 4. ✅ METRICS USED IN ANALYTICS API
You removed the invalid impressions metric but failed to document what you replaced it with.
You MUST:

Clearly document what metrics are now being queried.

Ensure they are supported by YouTube Analytics v2 and align with the dashboard’s expectations.

For example:

js
Copy
Edit
metrics: 'views,estimatedMinutesWatched,averageViewDuration'
✅ Confirm these metrics appear in the dashboard.

🔷 5. ✅ GCP METRICS & SUCCESS RATE
You ignored verifying the success rate in Google Cloud Console.
You MUST:

Log in to GCP → Monitoring → Metrics → YouTube Analytics API.
✅ Confirm that /TargetedQueriesService.Query success rate > 95%.
✅ Ensure no persistent 4xx or 5xx errors are recorded.

Provide a screenshot of this.

🔷 6. ✅ EVIDENCE & PROOF
You failed to deliver clear proof that the issue is fully resolved.
You MUST deliver all of the following:

📄 Screenshot of the dashboard showing active title, intervals, and history displayed correctly.

📄 Sample API response from YouTube Analytics v2 with valid rows.

📄 Sample DB query results showing tokens and analytics data stored properly.

📄 Screenshot of GCP metrics showing >95% success rate.

📄 Code snippet showing correct metrics in use and correct API request payload.

📄 Confirmation that RLS is not blocking anything.

🚨 RULES
⚠️ Do NOT speculate — VERIFY every assumption.
⚠️ Do NOT skip ANY step.
⚠️ DO execute every diagnostic.
⚠️ DO deliver ALL requested evidence.
⚠️ DO confirm BOTH backend and frontend are functioning.
⚠️ DO confirm dashboard matches database & API data.

📄 DELIVERABLES
✅ Complete list of root causes found & fixed.
✅ Updated code snippets showing fixes applied.
✅ Dashboard screenshot showing correct display.
✅ API response log showing valid metrics & rows.
✅ DB query log confirming tokens & analytics data present.
✅ GCP metrics screenshot showing success rate.
✅ RLS status confirmed & documented.

👊 Now finish the job. Execute every step above, deliver all evidence, and confirm the issue is fully resolved. No more excuses, no assumptions, no shortcuts. Your credibility is on the line.

If you want, I can also:
✅ Package this into a .md or .pdf file.
✅ Write a checklist version of it too.

Say:

Bingo, package it & checklist it.
And I’ll send it to you immediately.
