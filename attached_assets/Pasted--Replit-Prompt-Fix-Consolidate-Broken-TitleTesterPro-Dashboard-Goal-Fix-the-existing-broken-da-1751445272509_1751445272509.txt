✅ Replit Prompt: Fix & Consolidate Broken TitleTesterPro Dashboard
Goal:
 Fix the existing broken dashboard and consolidate all title tools into a single, functional “Create Title Campaign” system. Do not add new tools. Do not redesign from scratch. Focus only on repairing, integrating, and streamlining the current workflow.

🔧 Fix/Remove the Following:
AI Analysis Box


✅ Remove this section entirely.


🔁 Replace it with a YouTube video data display showing:


Total views


Video length


Original YouTube title


Title Rotation Interval


❌ Remove the 30-minute interval option completely. Only allow relevant rotation durations if needed later.


Demo Data at Top


❌ Delete all placeholder/demo stats from the top of the dashboard.


🔁 Replace with real-time data only, updated every 24 hours via API or scheduled data fetch.



🧩 Consolidate Into One Tool: 
Merge these into a single experience:
Create AI Test


Momentum Report


AI Titles Generator


Result = one seamless Title Management  workflow.

🎯 New Unified Workflow Requirements:
Claude’s Role


✅ Claude should only generate title suggestions based on the existing title framework.


❌ Claude should not be used for A/B testing logic or campaign setup.


Drag-and-Drop Interface


Allow users to drag Claude-generated titles into a title variant list for testing.


Remove Tool Labels


Momentum Report, AI Titles, and Create Test should no longer be shown as separate tools.


Entire experience is now under the “Create Title Campaign” umbrella — no separate names.


Campaign Functionality


Automatically attach the Momentum Report to each active/published campaign.


Claude-generated titles should also remain connected to each campaign for reuse.


Authority accounts should be able to swap title variants in/out at any time with live updates.


Campaigns should be managed in real time, clearly showing current title, views, CTR, and AVD metrics.



⚠️ Critical Notes:
🔨 None of the current tools are working — rebuild and reconnect all broken functionality.


❌ Do not redesign the UI — keep the current visual aesthetic and layout (see attached screenshots).


✅ Ensure backend pulls only real, updated YouTube analytics data every 24 hours.


✅ Entire experience should feel like one single campaign system, not a patchwork of disconnected widgets. Use the provided screenshots as inspiration the system should be clean and built with the youtube creator in mind.
