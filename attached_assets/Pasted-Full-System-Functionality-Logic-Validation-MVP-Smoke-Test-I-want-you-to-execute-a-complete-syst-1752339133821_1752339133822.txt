Full System Functionality & Logic Validation (MVP Smoke Test)
I want you to execute a complete, systematic smoke test & configuration validation of the TitleTesterPro application to confirm it is MVP-ready.

Do not just look at code — actually reason about the system as a whole. Assume nothing. Find misconfigurations, missing keys, broken flows, and hidden assumptions. I want this tested & validated as if preparing to launch to real users tomorrow.

✅ Deliverables:
🔷 Identify & document any issues, misconfigurations, or missing elements at any layer.
🔷 Recommend fixes for each issue found.
🔷 Confirm that the current system logic makes sense & is appropriate for an MVP of this app.
🔷 Output a single, clear report with priority levels (Critical / High / Medium / Low) for all findings.

🎯 Areas To Test & Validate:
1️⃣ Happy Path Validation
Visit https://titletesterpro.com → click Get Started → login → dashboard → create & view tests.

Identify exactly where the flow breaks, if at all, and why.

2️⃣ Environment & Config Validation
Check .env files (frontend & backend):

All required secrets & keys are present & correct.

No leftover localhost values or dummy tokens.

FRONTEND_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET, etc. are aligned with deployed environment.

3️⃣ Supabase Settings
Auth redirect URLs include https://titletesterpro.com/auth/callback (not www or localhost).

Scopes requested include all necessary YouTube scopes upfront.

RLS (Row Level Security) rules are correct and allow expected queries.

Provider tokens (YouTube) are saved & retrievable.

4️⃣ DNS & SSL
Both titletesterpro.com and www.titletesterpro.com resolve & have valid SSL certificates.

If www is unsupported, confirm it properly redirects to the root domain.

5️⃣ OAuth & Session Logic
Triple-check the login & session flow:

OAuth requests proper scopes upfront.

Callback properly saves the session & tokens.

Supabase session cookie (sb-access-token) is set & refreshed correctly.

No stale cookies or SameSite/CORS issues.

YouTube API tokens are fresh & valid.

6️⃣ Database Validation
Schema aligns with app requirements (users, accounts, tests, etc.).

No obsolete tables, columns, or conflicting token storage.

Data integrity: foreign keys & indexes are present.

Supabase database is primary & Neon is no longer used.

7️⃣ API & Endpoint Checks
All backend endpoints respond with expected status & data.

Proper error handling & fallback mechanisms.

Rate limiting & quota usage (YouTube & Supabase) are under control.

No unprotected sensitive endpoints.

8️⃣ System Logic & UX
Verify the business logic of the app actually makes sense for an MVP.

Does the user understand what to do at each step?

Is the flow intuitive: Login → Connect YouTube → Create Tests → View Results?

Are there unnecessary steps or confusing UI elements?

9️⃣ Hidden or Overlooked Risks
Check for unhandled errors & crash risks.

Look for hardcoded keys in code.

Validate CSRF protection, input sanitization & security headers.

Verify that you are not exceeding YouTube quota limits.

📋 Final Report Format:
🎯 Summary: Is the system MVP-ready? Yes/No.

🚀 Recommended Next Steps

Be thorough, skeptical, and explicit. Leave nothing unchecked. Treat this like a pre-launch QA audit & architecture review.
