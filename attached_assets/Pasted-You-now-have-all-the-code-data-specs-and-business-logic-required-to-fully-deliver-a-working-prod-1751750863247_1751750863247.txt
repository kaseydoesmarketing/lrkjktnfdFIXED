You now have all the code, data, specs, and business logic required to fully deliver a working, production-ready dashboard & platform. This is not optional — everything must function exactly as intended before marking this as complete.

🪓 Your Mission:
✅ Fix ALL the known issues without excuses.
✅ Connect all components end-to-end so they function properly.
✅ Remove hacks or half-finished features.
✅ Where something is broken or misconfigured, FIX IT.
✅ Test EVERYTHING thoroughly — don’t assume something works just because you touched it.

Specific Tasks to Complete:
1️⃣ Resolve the issue where a new title campaign test fails to start. This is a blocker — no campaign = useless platform.
2️⃣ Ensure the dashboard updates in real-time (or appropriately polled) with accurate:

Active tests

Completed tests

Total views

Avg CTR

Current title
Metrics must match what’s coming from the YouTube API, synchronized correctly.
3️⃣ Verify the Stripe payment integration is fully functional and hitting the correct account and plan. Currently, it appears misdirected or broken. Fix it, test it end-to-end (including actual test payment).
4️⃣ Make sure rotating titles happen at the interval selected, and the system records data hourly (or as designed) when a title is rotated.
5️⃣ All forms (plans, campaigns, tests, etc.) must submit, validate, and trigger correct backend logic without throwing errors.
6️⃣ Any intermittent bugs or crashes? Root cause them and fix, not just band-aid them.
7️⃣ Remove unnecessary code, logs, and clutter. Leave it clean & maintainable.

Deliverable:
🚀 A fully working application where:

I can create and launch a new test campaign without error.

The dashboard reflects accurate, up-to-date data.

Payments work properly via Stripe.

Title rotations and metrics sync flawlessly with YouTube.

NO broken buttons, no failing forms, no silent errors.

Expectations:
DO NOT send it back unfinished claiming “waiting for info.” You have everything you need here.

DO NOT assume “good enough.” If you wouldn’t stake your name on it working, don’t ship it.

DO NOT overcomplicate — fix what’s broken, wire up what’s not connected, test thoroughly, deliver cleanly.

Run a full QA pass yourself. Don’t leave QA to the client.

Timeline:
⏳ This should be treated with urgency. Every hour this isn’t working costs the business. No dragging feet. Fix it completely, test it properly, deliver it ready to launch.
