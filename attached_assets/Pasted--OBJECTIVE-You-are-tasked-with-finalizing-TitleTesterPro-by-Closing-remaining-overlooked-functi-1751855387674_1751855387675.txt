🎯 OBJECTIVE
You are tasked with finalizing TitleTesterPro by:
✅ Closing remaining overlooked functionality gaps.
✅ Adding the ability to edit active campaigns (including intervals) from the dashboard.
✅ Verifying — with proof — that TitleTesterPro is accurately collecting YouTube API & Analytics data and is no longer failing at 100%.

🔍 REQUIRED DELIVERABLES
🔷 1️⃣ Editable Active Campaigns
Currently, active campaigns are locked to the interval set at creation (e.g., 1 hour). This is unacceptable for a live product.
You MUST:

Add functionality to allow editing of:

Interval time (e.g., change from 60 → 30 → 15 minutes).

Titles in the rotation (if required).

Ensure the updated interval applies immediately to the scheduler & persists.

Ensure updated campaigns do NOT break logging, DB schema, or dashboard display.

Update frontend/dashboard to support editing:

Provide clear UX: “Edit Interval” & “Save Changes.”

Validate & sanitize user input.

Show proof: screenshot/video of editing an active campaign & observing new interval reflected in DB & logs.

🔷 2️⃣ API Data Verification
YouTube Data & Analytics APIs are the core of this product. You MUST:

Re-test both APIs end-to-end.

Confirm that Analytics API v2 no longer fails at 100% error rate.

Show actual metrics returned:

views

estimatedMinutesWatched

averageViewDuration

subscribersGained

Prove that the data is being written to the DB & surfaced in the dashboard.

Run GCP monitoring → confirm >95% success on /TargetedQueriesService.Query.

Show proof:
✅ Sample API response payload with real data rows.
✅ DB rows showing the data inserted.
✅ GCP metrics screenshot.

🔷 3️⃣ Final QA on Overlooked Areas
From prior audits, also validate & deliver proof of:
✅ OAuth token refresh flow (does NOT break after expiry — refreshes properly).
✅ Brand Account support (ensure correct channelId even for Brand accounts).
✅ Test data hygiene (DB does NOT contain old/junk users/tests/logs).
✅ Frontend responsiveness & graceful fallback when no data yet.
✅ Quota & rate limit safety — demonstrate no risk of hitting GCP limits.

📄 RULES
⚠️ Do NOT assume — VERIFY everything.
⚠️ Do NOT stop until you can show all deliverables above with clear proof.
⚠️ Do NOT break existing functionality while adding editability.
⚠️ DO provide:

Screenshot/video of editable campaign working live.

API response log proving Analytics API is returning valid data.

DB queries proving rotations + metrics logged properly.

GCP metrics screenshot showing >95% success rate.

Any updated code snippets or schema changes.

📄 SUMMARY OF EXPECTED OUTCOMES
✅ Active campaigns can be edited mid-flight (interval & optionally titles).
✅ Analytics & Data APIs are working at >95% success rate and logging accurate metrics.
✅ Dashboard reflects correct data & intervals.
✅ DB & API flow is stable, clean, and production-ready.
✅ No critical overlooked issues remain.

👊 Now execute and deliver full proof for ALL points above. Do NOT come back with partial work or questions — finish it fully and deliver evidence.
