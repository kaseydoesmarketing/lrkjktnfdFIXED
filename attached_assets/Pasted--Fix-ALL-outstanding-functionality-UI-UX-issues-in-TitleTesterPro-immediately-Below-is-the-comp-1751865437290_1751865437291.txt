üö® Fix ALL outstanding functionality & UI/UX issues in TitleTesterPro immediately. Below is the complete checklist you MUST deliver, without excuses or partial fixes:

1Ô∏è‚É£ YouTube API Integration

Ensure BOTH YouTube Data API v3 and YouTube Analytics API v2 are implemented properly.

Use v3 for real-time metrics (views, likes, comments, etc.) displayed immediately on dashboard.

Use v2 for aggregated analytics (watch time, CTR, avg view duration, subscribers gained).

Fix the v2 implementation so errors are minimized, correct metrics are requested, and values shown on dashboard match YouTube Studio closely.

Validate that all OAuth scopes (youtube.readonly, youtube, youtube.force-ssl, yt-analytics.readonly) are being properly used and tokens are valid.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Campaign Rotation

Confirm that campaign title rotations occur at the correct intervals.

Logs for each rotation must be stored in the database, correctly tied to the campaign & user.

Countdown timer for next rotation must display visibly on the dashboard in red (clean, not overpowering), associated with each campaign.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Functionality & UI

Implement the ability to edit an active campaign: titles & interval, via an intuitive modal as promised.

Align the dashboard design with the landing page style and color scheme (blue-to-purple gradient, polished typography, premium aesthetic, luxury SaaS feel).

Ensure it remains creator-friendly, clean, interactive, and refreshing.

Ensure the dashboard can scroll through ALL of the user‚Äôs videos when creating/selecting a campaign ‚Äî no hard 50-video limit.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Payments

Fix Stripe integration so that clicking the Pro & Authority plans routes users to correct Stripe checkout URLs for monthly billing and collects payment properly.

5Ô∏è‚É£ General QA

Ensure all logs, metrics, and campaign data persist correctly in the database (Supabase).

Run a full QA pass and deliver evidence (screenshots & logs) showing:

Real rotations happening with logs stored.

Accurate YouTube metrics displayed.

Valid, refreshed tokens in accounts table.

Dashboard showing updated campaign edit modal & countdown timers.

Stripe checkout pages working.

Remove obsolete code paths & avoid token duplication between users and accounts tables.

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT just say it‚Äôs fixed ‚Äî validate with actual live data, test rotations, and screenshots of dashboard with correct data.
‚ö° Prioritize functionality, stability, and alignment with brand aesthetic.
üìù Deliver a summary of what was fixed, how, and anything remaining to be addressed.

Start now & confirm when complete. This is a priority.
