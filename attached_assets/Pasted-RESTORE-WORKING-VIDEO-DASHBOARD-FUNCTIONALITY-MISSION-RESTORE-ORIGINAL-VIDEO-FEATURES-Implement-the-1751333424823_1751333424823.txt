RESTORE WORKING VIDEO DASHBOARD FUNCTIONALITY
MISSION: RESTORE ORIGINAL VIDEO FEATURES
Implement the exact video functionality that was working before the dashboard revamp. Stop experimenting - use the proven working patterns.
CORE VIDEO FUNCTIONALITY TO RESTORE
1. VIDEO ADDITION CAPABILITY

Restore the working video upload/addition system
Use the exact same API endpoints and methods that worked before
Implement the original form structure and validation
Ensure proper file handling and metadata extraction
Test video addition thoroughly before proceeding

2. VIDEO TITLE & INFORMATION RETRIEVAL

Restore the working video metadata pulling system
Use the original API calls that successfully retrieved:

Video titles
Video descriptions
Video metadata (duration, views, etc.)
Video thumbnails


Implement the exact data structure that worked before
Ensure proper error handling for failed retrievals

3. VIDEO SORTING & FILTERING SYSTEM

Restore the working sorting functionality
Implement the original sorting options:

By date added
By title (alphabetical)
By duration
By view count
Any other sorting that was working


Restore filtering capabilities:

By category/tags
By date range
By status


Use the exact UI patterns that worked before

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
STEP 1: EXTRACT WORKING CODE

Identify the last working commit before dashboard revamp
Extract the exact video functionality code:

Video addition components
Video data fetching logic
Sorting and filtering components
API integration patterns


Document the working data flow and API endpoints

STEP 2: RESTORE CORE FEATURES

Implement video addition first

Use the original working form structure
Test video upload and metadata extraction
Verify data saves correctly


Implement video retrieval

Use the original API calls and data structure
Test title and information pulling
Verify data displays correctly


Implement sorting/filtering

Use the original sorting logic
Test all sorting options
Verify filtering works as expected



STEP 3: INTEGRATION & TESTING

Integrate with current authentication

Ensure video features work with current auth system
Test with actual user sessions
Verify permissions and access control


Full functionality testing

Test complete video workflow: add → view → sort → filter
Test with multiple videos
Test edge cases and error scenarios



CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
USE ORIGINAL WORKING PATTERNS

DON'T REINVENT: Use the exact code patterns that worked before
SAME APIs: Use the same endpoint calls and data structures
SAME UI FLOW: Implement the same user interaction patterns
PROVEN LOGIC: Use the sorting and filtering logic that was stable

AVOID CURRENT PROBLEMATIC CODE

DON'T use any of the recent "fixes" that aren't working
DON'T overcomplicate with new patterns or libraries
DON'T change working API calls or data structures
FOCUS on functionality, not visual improvements

SUCCESS CRITERIA
✅ Video Addition: Can successfully add videos with full metadata
✅ Video Display: All video titles and information pull correctly
✅ Sorting Works: All original sorting options function properly
✅ Filtering Works: Video filtering by various criteria works
✅ Stable Performance: No disappearing, no white screens
✅ Data Persistence: Video data saves and loads reliably
IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

Find working commit with video functionality
Extract video components and API logic
Implement video addition using original pattern
Restore video display with original data structure
Add sorting/filtering using original logic
Test thoroughly at each step
Deploy stable version with full video functionality

GOAL: Restore the reliable, working video dashboard that users could actually use before the revamp broke everything.
NO MORE EXPERIMENTS - JUST RESTORE WHAT WORKED.
