✅ TitleTester Pro – Dashboard Fixes & Feature Logic (Claude Implementation Prompt)
1. Active Tests Section (Top of Dashboard)
Should display:

Number of Active Tests

Real Total Views (per active test, not site-wide dummy data)

Real Average Duration (AVD) of each test

Completed Tests Count – must only reflect tests that have truly completed

Each Active Test should:

Be expandable to reveal detailed logs.

Include:

Current Title Variant

Log of all title changes (e.g., “Title changed to ‘XYZ’ at 12:00 PM”)

Time left until the next title swap (i.e., “Next change in 34 minutes”)

Total interval count, when each one started, and what title was shown.

Note: These logs are not currently populating – Claude must ensure logging is tracked and stored with timestamps.

2. Create Test Function (Button UI Fixes)
When clicked:

The AI load screen must show the correct YouTube thumbnails for each video.

The CTR data must be accurate, pulled directly from YouTube API.

Remove placeholder or inaccurate stats that are currently being displayed.

3. Video Library Panel (Far Right of Dashboard)
Remove the “High / Medium / Low” CTR performance indicators – they belong to a deprecated feature and are irrelevant now.

4. Completed Tests Section (Top-Right Area)
When a test is:

Paused, Canceled, Resumed, or Marked Completed:

That state should update live at the top dashboard.

Add functionality for:

Canceling a test → should completely delete it from the list.

Completing a test → moves it to the “Completed Tests” section.

Pausing/Resuming → must retain test history and swap intervals.

5. All Tests (Bottom Section)
Should include:

Option to cancel or permanently delete any test listed here.

Ensure the UX flow is clear with action buttons per test entry (Delete, Resume, Pause, etc.).

6. Logout Button (Top Right)
Currently leads to a 404 error.

Fix it so that:

It logs the user out of TitleTester Pro, not their YouTube account.

It should redirect to a clean, branded logout success screen or the login page.

Notes for Claude (Styling and Aesthetic Guidance)
All of these changes should reflect creator-first design principles:

Clean, minimal UI

Seamless interaction without clutter

Think: Notion-level UX, Figma-grade layouts

Organize data similar to SEMrush or YouTube Studio: collapsible panels, clean visual hierarchy, real-time feedback.
