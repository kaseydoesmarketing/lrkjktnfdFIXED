Agent: Claude
Goal: Repair broken functionality and enhance user experience using the pre-established visual brand. Make the interface aesthetically pleasing and intuitive for content creators.

🛠️ Functional Fixes & Enhancements
1. Active Test Section (Top Metrics Area)
✅ Redesign and restructure as follows:

This section must reflect real data from each currently Active Test only.

Each Active Test should be an expandable card (accordion-style).

When expanded, it must include the following details per test:

✅ Total Views

✅ Average CTR

✅ Average View Duration

✅ Current Title Being Shown

✅ Complete Change Log:

Timestamp of every title switch

Title used at each interval

Duration each title was active

Performance data per title

➡️ Data should update in real time or with a 24-hour refresh interval, like SEMrush-style analytics.

2. Separation of Sections
Clearly separate the “Active Test” area from the “Video Library.”

Use color, padding, or containers to make the distinction obvious.

This prevents clutter and enhances user clarity between:

Active Campaign Analytics

Video Assets & History

🧹 Remove Broken UI Elements
❌ Remove the “Create Test” button in the Video Library (far right) — it is non-functional.

❌ Fix or remove the “Logout” button — currently does not work. It must either:

Properly end the user session and redirect to the login page

Or be disabled until functionality is complete

🎨 Design Guidelines for Claude
Use existing design themes already present in TitleTesterPro:

Gradient buttons

Soft shadows

Modular card design

High-contrast stat blocks

The new expandable ActiveTest block should feel like a creator analytics tool — inspired by tools like TubeBuddy, SEMrush, and Notion.

Keep the style fun but professional and focused, optimized for YouTube creators and marketers.

✅ Output Format:
Claude should return a:

Figma-compatible UI concept OR

Component-ready design spec with:

Structure (divs, accordions, cards)

Styling (colors, fonts, shadows)

Suggested layout grids
