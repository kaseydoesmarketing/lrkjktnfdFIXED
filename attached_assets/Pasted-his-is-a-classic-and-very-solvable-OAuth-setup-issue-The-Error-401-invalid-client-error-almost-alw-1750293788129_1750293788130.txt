his is a classic and very solvable OAuth setup issue. The Error 401: invalid_client error almost always means one thing: the Client ID your application is sending to Google does not match what Google has on record.

Let's get this fixed. We will also fix a second error you would have received immediately after this one.

Part 1: Fixing the "invalid_client" Error
This error is happening because your application's environment variables (your secrets) are incorrect or not being loaded properly.

The Most Likely Cause: A simple copy-paste error or a failure to update the secrets in your Replit environment.

Solution: The "Copy-Paste Refresh"

Go to your Google Cloud Credentials page (your first screenshot).
Find the Client ID. To the right of the long string of characters, click the Copy icon. This ensures you copy the entire string perfectly.
Go to your Replit project. In the left-hand sidebar, click the Padlock icon to open the Secrets tab.
Find the secret key named GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID. Delete whatever is in the value field and paste the Client ID you just copied from Google.
Now, go back to the Google Cloud page. Find your Client secret. Click the Copy icon next to it.
Go back to your Replit Secrets. Find the secret key named GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET and paste the Client Secret you just copied.
Crucial Step for Replit: After updating secrets, you must restart your application. Stop the running application in Replit and start it again to ensure it loads the new, correct secrets.
Wait about 2-3 minutes for the changes to sync, then try signing in again. This solves the problem 99% of the time.

Part 2: Preventing the Next Error You Will See
I noticed a small but critical issue in your setup that will cause the next error, which is redirect_uri_mismatch. Let's fix it now.

The default callback URL for the NextAuth.js Google Provider ends in /google. Your configuration is missing this last part.

Solution: Update Your Redirect URIs

Go back to your Google Cloud Credentials page.
Under the "Authorized redirect URIs" section, you need to edit your two URIs.
Click the pencil icon to edit URI 1 and change it to: http://localhost:5000/api/auth/callback/google
Click the pencil icon to edit URI 2 and change it to: https://kaseydoesmarket-workspace.replit.app/api/auth/callback/google
You are just adding /google to the end of each line. Click "Save" at the bottom of the page. It can take 5-10 minutes for this change to be active across all of Google's servers.

Troubleshooting Checklist
If you're still having issues, run through this list:

Check	Action
1. Are your secrets an exact match?	Do the "Copy-Paste Refresh" described in Part 1 again. This is the most common point of failure.
2. Did you restart your Replit app?	Your app will use old, cached secrets until it is fully restarted. Click the "Stop" button and then "Run".
3. Did you fix the Redirect URIs?	Ensure /google is at the end of both redirect URIs in the Google Console, as described in Part 2.
4. Have you waited a few minutes?	Especially after changing the Redirect URIs, you may need to wait 5-10 minutes before the changes work globally. G
