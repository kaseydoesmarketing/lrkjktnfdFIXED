   - Required to read video metadata (titles, descriptions, thumbnails)
   - Used to display user's videos for A/B testing selection
   - Enables analytics data retrieval for performance comparison

2. **https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube**
   - Required to update video titles for A/B testing
   - Core functionality: temporarily changes video titles to test performance
   - Used only on user-owned videos with explicit user consent

3. **https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl**
   - Ensures secure API communications
   - Required for production-grade YouTube API access
